# This is a script to help with tidying up unwanted Tyk API keys directly from Redis.
# It does not use tyk APIs at all.
# It supports both delete or list mode. Use the --list option to explore what keys exist and what ones should
# be deleted before replacing --list with --delete to purge the unwanted keys.

# For caution the orgid of the keys to be considered must be given even when there is only one org id in redis.

# Keys have an expiry timestamp in epoch seconds. Keys which expired before the timestamp given in --epoch will
# be considered for listing or deletion.

# The selected keys can be further narrowed down using the --policy and --api options. Either or both can be given.
# Only apikeys which match the given --policy and/or --api options will be included but only at most one of each can be given.

# USE THIS OPTION WITH CAUTION: '--epoch 0'
# Keys with an expiry of 0 are set to never expire. They are dealt with as a special case and only considered
# when '--epoch 0' is given.
# Using the --api and --policy options will allow the non-expiring keys for a particular API or policy to be removed
# when they are combined with '--epoch 0'

# USE THIS OPTION WITH CAUTION: --include-jwt-sessions
# --include-jwt-sessions means that keys created as JWT session objects will be considered for deletion.
# Deleting these will allow them to be recreated when a JWT with the corresponding sub is presented 
# as an auth token to the gateway. This is almost certainly not what you want.
# For example: 
#    JWT auth is setup with a policy that defaults to a 1 hour key life.
#    A JWT is presented with a particular subject and the corresponding key is created.
#    That key expires after an hour and access is denied when the JWT is presented
#    This script is used to remove that expired key
#    The JWT is presented again and the corresponding key is created allowing access for another hour
#    So removing the key has restored access via the JWT rather than blocking it

# The script is not redis cluster aware. It must be pointed at a master redis replica (if replication is active)
# If redis is sharded the script must be used on each master in turn

# Be aware that the database may change between --list and --delete in a live environment

# Because this script doesn't trigger a gateway keyspace update pub/sub it may cause panics when the gateway tries
# to retrieve a key it believes to exist
